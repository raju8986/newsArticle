        <h1>Here's why full-stack web developers get fat pay hikes and are the most sought-after</h1>
        <p>A full-stack developer is a software engineer who can take care of the full stack in web development, from
            the front end to the back end. Since the Covid outbreak, these roles have become the most sought after
            software jobs.</p>

        <h4>The story of two <span class="mark">full stack web developer</span> </h4>
        <p class="lead">Kaushik, an engineer in his mid-20s is a <span class="mark">full stack web developer</span>  in a Bengaluru-Based startup. He enrolled
            in an <span class="mark">online learning platform</span> to learn full stack web development in late 2019 to hone his coding skills.
            Little did Kaushik imagine that the course he enrolled for would become one of the most sought-after, post
            the COVID-19 pandemic began</p>
        <p class="lead">He landed a job paying  <span class="mark">Rs 6 lakh per annum</span>  in march 2020, and this doubled to <span class="mark">Rs 12 lakh</span>  annually a few
            months ago. All this was with less than two years experience as full stack web developer</p>
        <p class="lead">
            Kaushik is not alone. <span class="mark">Benjamin</span> is a techie with six years' experience earning <span class="mark">Rs 15 lakh</span> annually. Companies
            are now rolling out the red carpet, offering him a 100 percent-plus hike to make the shift. There is a 50
            percent chance that he might hold out for more
        </p>
        <p class="lead">This is a scenario that would be hard to imagine even a year ago.</p>
        <p class="lead">If you are a <span class="mark">full stack web developer</span> in india today, companies are willing to give you a hike as hight as
           <span class="mark">120 percent hike</span>, even if you are a fresher with a couple of years' experience like Kaushik. Hikes are rarely
            less than <span class="mark">50 percent.</span> </p>
